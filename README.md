# K-Means Visualization App

An app used to visualize the working of the K-Means clustering algorithm.

You can try out the app [here](https://kristijanr.github.io/kmeans-visualization-app/).

# Project info

This project was created as a final assignment for the Introduction to Data Science course
at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCSE) in Skopje, under the mentorship of
Professor Andrea Kulakov, Ph.D.

This app is an educational tool designed to illustrate the inner workings
of the K-means clustering algorithm using a custom implementation of the algorithm in JavaScript to display
the knowlegde aquired by the creators from the coursework.
